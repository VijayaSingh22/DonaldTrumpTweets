a lovely letter from the daughter of the late great john wayne. our country could use a john wayne right now.   great poll- thank you nevada!\\n#makeamericagreatagain #trump2016   i\\'m going to be live with @ericbolling and @kimguilfoyle to ring in the new year 2016. everybody should tune in to @foxnews tomorrow night! thank you hilton head, south carolina! #makeamericagreatagain #trump2016   thank you hilton head, south carolina! @scteamtrump #trump2016     i never thought i\\'d be saying this but i\\'ve really enjoyed  @richlowry on television lately, and he was terrific hosting @seanhannity joe mcquaid (@deucecrew) is desperately trying to sell the @unionleader. it\\'s a loser, and my comments haven\\'t helped him much. the dying @unionleader newspaper in nh is in turmoil over my comments about them- like a bully that got knocked out! \"@truthisall1: @realdonaldtrump @charleshurt @seanhannity good morning, mr. trump. you\\'re so awesome. #trump2016   \"@bfb123456: @trumpiowa @playstrumpcard @realdonaldtrump  wow! fantastic!. who knew americans were so smart? great to know we\\'re so smart\" \"@hammetjohn: donaldtrump - how do u do it donald. no one could keep up with u at your pace. shows how hard u will work for us as president\" \"@videosigninc: @realdonaldtrump keep the momentum going mr. trump. all the best to you for the new year. make america great again !\" thanks \"@hashtag1usa: @realdonaldtrump what do you think of jeb cancelling his iowa rally last night ?   i went, he didn\\'t! iowa was fantastic last night, amazing crowd and people. i\\'m now in florida, getting ready to go to south carolina. big crowd, very exciting .@charleshurt   you were great on @seanhannity last night. thanks for the nice words. make america great again! thank you council bluffs, iowa! the silent majority, is silent no more!\\n#trump2016 #fitn     joe mcquaid (@deucecrew) of the dying union leader wanted ads, lunches, donations, speeches from me, and tweets---very unethical. the great people of new hampshire, who i love, are not properly served by the dying union leader newspaper. shows how dumb joe mcquaid (@deucecrew) of the dying union leader is to put out the letter i wrote saying why i didn\\'t do his failed debate! i hope @tgowdysc does better for rubio than he did at the #benghazi hearings, which were a total disaster for republicans &amp; america! we need a real president!   looking forward to being in council bluffs, iowa, later today. despite weather, rally is on -- will be fantastic! #makeamericagreatagain! so, i have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place. jeb bush has spent $59 million &amp; done. run country my way! my campaign for president is $35,000,000 under budget, i have spent very little (and am in 1st place).now i will spend big in iowa/n.h./s.c. \"minorities line up behind.....donald trump\" #trump2016 #makeamericagreatagain     .@jessebwatters is terrific at hosting on @foxnews - he really gets it! remember that bill clinton was brought in to help hillary against obama in 2008. he was terrible, failed badly, and was called a racist! \"@leemiracle3: @foxnews @charleshurt @realdonaldtrump trump listening to voters, unlike gop\" \"@umakemeill: @foxnews @jebbush @hillaryclinton @realdonaldtrump   \"@ijnipgm: no casualties. just victory, victory, and more victory as you proclaim the truth that is in your heart. we love god and usa\" \"@sunquist007: @jebbush why do u keep trying to attack trump? really dumb strategy! u lose, he wins! #lets make america great again!!!!!\" \"@slone: flashback1986: @realdonaldtrump saved a georgia farm     thank you, nice memories! thank you- nashua, new hampshire! #makeamericagreatagain #trump2016 \\n#nhpolitics #fitn     thank you! #trump2016 \\n    thank you to a #trump2016 supporter for this video of my campaign- over the past 6 months. video:   strange, but i see wacko bernie sanders allies coming over to me because i\\'m lowering taxes, while he will double &amp; triple them, a disaster! wages in are country are too low, good jobs are too few,  and people have lost faith in our leaders.we need smart and strong leadership now! many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone, shipped to other countries. we now are part time, sad! i will fix! the middle-class has worked so hard, are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of - and no  effective raise in years. bad if hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women\\'s card on me, she\\'s wrong! \"@borntobegop: @realdonaldtrump we need a real president to get things done, and that\\'s why we want you!\"  thank you. hopefully the republican national committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in virginia\\'s republican party. fast! straighten out the republican party of virginia before it is too late. stupid!  rnc .@berniesanders-who blew his campaign when he gave hillary a pass on her e-mail crime, said that i feel wages in america are too high. lie! the voters the republican party of virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory. the dems love it! be smart and win for a change! r.p.virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row. will now not allow desperately needed new voters. suicidal mistake. rnc must act now!

one of the saddest things in journalism is what happened to the formerly great @ap. they have lost their way and are no longer credible. what is our president doing?   \"gop voters trust donald trump to keep our country safe\"   refugees from syria are now pouring into our great country. who knows who they are - some could be isis. is our president insane? i, along with almost everyone else, have so little confidence in president obama. he has a horrible attitude-a man who is resigned to defeat so many great polls like reuters - big leads everywhere. new hampshire really special! we will win big and make america great again! thank you tennessee! #trump2016   just received a copy of @sarahpalinusa new book -- a great read! sarah is a terrific person. great poll numbers out of @umassamherst. thank you!

republicans must stop listening to dopes like @karlrove who still insists mitt romney won the last election. think big &amp; think strong! wow, @macys shares are down more than 40% this year. i never knew my ties &amp; shirts not being sold there would have such a big impact! interesting article from highly respected wayne allyn root   remember, i was the one who said attack the oil (isis source of wealth) a long time ago. everyone scoffed, now they\\'re attacking the oil. \"@sarahpalinusa: from st. patrick\\'s cathedral, nyc: blessings, prayers and heartfelt concern for those in paris. \"@streetr77:  @johnlegere @tmobile didn\\'t know he was ceo of tmobile, i have t-mobile, it\\'s pathetic, dropped calls, no service.\" tom brady just did it again. he is not only a great guy, he is, without question, the best quarterback!

congrats to the new gov. of texas, @gregabbott_tx, for taking a tough &amp; bold stance at the border. should have been done long ago by perry. i have a proven track record supporting our veterans. veterans deserve universal access to care. va scandal proves politicians are inept. ....that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care. it\\'s a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our veterans..... i will make this right for our great vets! all he does is go on television is talk, talk, talk, but incapable of doing anything. ....john mccain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for veterans to successfully manage their lives. the veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years... captured or not, all our soldiers are heroes! in addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our vets, john mccain let us down by losing to barack obama in his run for president! just left family leadership summit in iowa, got a standing ovation from many wonderful people. i will be back soon. statement on john mccain-   i am now in iowa getting ready to speak. people are always amazed to find out that i am protestant (presbyterian). great. the $10 billion (net worth) is after all debt and liabilities. so simple to understand but @cnn &amp; @cnnpolitics is just plain dumb! ratings starved @cnn and @cnnpolitics does not cover me accurately. why can\\'t they get it right - it\\'s really not that hard! made a speech in arkansas last night before a record gop crowd. great spirit and amazing people. make america great again!
